I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>",other,Carlos Loan,760xx,TX,12.37,0.0,04/01/2007,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,6547,57.4,12.0,f,0.0,2,PC3

For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).   Many of these credit card purchases were from marketing and investments in building our business, at the time of these rate increases we were working hard to pay off these debts. We have no doubt that we will easily be able to pay off this loan and give you a good, safe return on your investment.   Thank you!",debt consolidation,Loan To Eliminate Credit Card Debt,335xx,FL,13.43,0.0,12/01/1991,0.0,,89.0,6.0,1.0,30497,93.8,14.0,f,0.0,3,PC4

My income will only get more with raises and bonuses next year.  The problem is I am plagued from bad decisions I made in College and Student Loans.  This hurts my credit score.  I am seeking a debt consolidation because my mom ran up the American Express bill (we are both on the account) and they require the account to be paid in full each month.  The balance slowly increased and I wasn't paying attention until it grew to what it is now.  Despite my income, I cannot make the lump sum payment they want.  I could easily pay it off on an installment basis, but they will not transfer the balance to an installment basis, and I cannot pay it off in one month.  The American Express is now cancelled, and my mom is no longer a signatory on any of my credit accounts.  However, I want to pay it off as quickly as possible so it does not affect my credit.  I fully expect to have this loan paid off within 12 months.  I plan to pay at least double the monthly payment each month.

1314,1315,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,5,MORTGAGE,85000.0,VERIFIED - income source,n,"I am seeking a loan for a kitchen remodel.  My wife and I have obtained detailed cost estimates for the project, which sum to $28,300.  At this time, we have $18,000 saved for the project, and a loan of $12,000 from the Lending Club would provide us with the difference (plus a margin of additional funds for the unexpected).  We bought our house at the end of 2005, which was just about at the peak of housing prices in our area.  We put 20% down on our house at purchase, and have a fixed rate mortgage at 6%.  Although cursory appraisals do not indicate that we are íëŒ¢í«í_í«íèupside downíëŒ¢í«í_í«Œù with our mortgage, we have not had any success securing a traditional home equity loan though either our local credit union or a large national bank.  It appears that our situation is typical for these strange economic times: we have strong credit scores, a reasonable financing goal and steady income, but limited options for borrowing for remodeling.  Hence, we decided to turn to the Lending Club to finance this project.   My wife and I have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and we expect that our current house will be our íëŒ¢í«í_í«íèforever houseíëŒ¢í«í_í«Œù.  We do not view our home as a short- or medium-term investment; it is simply where we want to live.  That stated, our kitchen is the weakest part of our house, and so we expect a relatively high return on this remodeling project.  Should something terrible happen and we are forced to sell our house, Lending Club lenders would share a proportionally small fraction of this risk, since our own funds will support well over half of the cost of the remodeling project.  My income is very reliable: I have a Ph.D. and a tenure-track position at a major research institution.  I have held this position for nearly six years.  My annual reviews have been very positive, and I have every indication that I will spend my career here.  In addition, over the last year I have had success with private consulting, which is the source for much of our savings.    I have been married for 11 years.  My wife is a painter, and is doing quite well on the local art scene.  Naturally, she has a day job, which is in the area of  non-profit administration. She has worked on and off in this area for over ten years, and she has held her current position for over four years.  It is a part-time situation that supports our finances but leaves her afternoons free to spend time in the studio before the kids get home from school.     As my credit report shows, we have consistently managed our finances responsibly.  The one blemish on my report is from a mortgage payment I missed a few years ago: I failed to update our automatic bill payment after our mortgage rate was adjusted (former mortgage, again our current mortgage is fixed).  If I recall correctly I underpaid by $26, but the lender was unsympathetic and reported it despite my pleadings.  Our current mortgage payment is approximately 20% of our gross income, and we pay on time, always.  We quit using credit cards about two years ago.  I have two modest car payments: $200 and $270.  The latter is for a car I bought my mother, who has been on disability since I was a teen and needs our help.   The estimated payment for the loan we are seeking will be in the vicinity of $375/month.  This is about what we paid in preschool tuition for my 5-year-old last year.  But he is going to kindergarten, and we will soon be relieved of this expenditure.  So, in effect, our monthly finances will change little when we take on this remodeling loan, and we know that we will be comfortable with this payment.  Taking the new payment into account, our monthly household debt-to-income ratio (not including mortgage) will be about 12%.

3511,3512,"eBrothers Solutions, Inc.",5,MORTGAGE,72000.0,VERIFIED - income,n,"In short, I have a relatively young computer consulting company with some credit card debt. I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, IäóÁí_ŒÈve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The äóÁí_íèone manäóÁí_Œù shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, äóÁí_íèall you can eatäóÁí_Œù support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. ItäóÁí_ŒÈs also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a companyäóÁí_ŒÈs IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etcäóÁí__) A typical äóÁí_íècomputeräóÁí_Œù company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business IäóÁí_ŒÈve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. ItäóÁí_ŒÈs a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.  I appreciate your time and please feel free to contact me for questions.  Thanks for your consideration.

I have been faithfully paying these credit cards on time every month ever since I opened them 4 years ago. At no fault of my own I have watched my interest rates escalate. All but one of them now have an APR of more than 21%! Earlier this year I attempted to get a credit union credit card and perform a balance transfer, however the financial representative wanted me to pay them down by $3,000.00 and for me to then apply again once I had done this. <br/><br/>I have developed the useful habit of paying bills online with automation for several years. This has helped me stay current with all of my bills and in good standing with all of my creditors.<br/><br/>I need to pay off all of these credit cards so that I can reach my other financial goals. My top financial goal, next to having zero credit card debt, is to establish an emergency fund. I also want peace of mind and to make more of my money by not putting liens on my future income. I want to control my finances and pay cash for things. I will close all of these credit cards except for one. I will not carry a balnce on this card. I will use it with merchants/servicers who only accept credit cards and this will also help me maintain a mix of different types of credit for my FICO score.<br/><br/>I currently allocate $454.00 per month in my budget towards debt repayment. If I were to get this loan, the repayment would be $359.00. I would have almost a $100.00 surplus every month from just the debt repayment allocation in my budget. This money will help me save toward my emergency fund. And with the lower interest rate on this loan, I can get out of debt sooner.<br/><br/>My job is pretty stable and we're growing. We just acquired another company in August 2010 and with the financial crisis we're in, more and more people are turning to agencies like ours for help. My director and supervisor are very pleased with my work. I enjoy giving my best both at work and in all other areas of my life.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a loan from Lending Club so that I can take control and know that I paid off my credit cards and that I paid back my loan.

Due to a rare genetic condition that I have that could be passed on to our child, my wife and I have decided to adopt.  We are very excited because my wife has three adopted sisters from Africa, and it has been a great experience.  We have great credit and a good income; however the adoption costs are around $25,000 so we would like to use a loan to spread our cash flow out a little.  We will get reimbursed for over half of this loan from my company and from our tax refunds within the next year, so there should be no problem paying the loan back.  We are just trying to not have to dip into our savings too much.  We would greatly appreciate a loan that will help us to make our dream of our first child come true.  As a young couple we really need the help in getting our family started.  My financial situation: As my profile shows, I have excellent credit.  My family owns a car dealership, so we don't have a car payment.  We only have our mortgage, a couple of college loans from my Masters degree, and we pay off our credit cards every month and only use them to get airline miles.  I have a good job as a software project manager and make over $80,000 a year.  I also have an extremely good debt to income ratio.  I have a solid history of debt repayment with no late payments ever on my mortgage or credit cards.

I make enough in my current job that I can certainly afford loan payments, but would have to wait quite a while to save up enough to pay for my educational expenses up front. In the current economy, only the wealthy and the destitute(the only ones who qualify for much financial aid) can afford to go to school using the more traditional payment types. Because I make enough to live on, I don't have the opportunity to better myself without seeking a loan.   My credit history and score are reasonably good, and hopefully will be improving more in the coming years. I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax. Since I am able to take on more time, within certain limits of course, I can work more to pay for extras such as vacation, without sacrificing paying my bills. I believe that I am a good candidate because of the aforementioned, and hope that you will view me as such.

This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.

I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are ""above and beyond"" the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such ""above and beyond"" circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).

My intentions are to use the majority of the tax credit to pay off my loan. I do understand that there is a possibility that for some reason I may not receive the tax credit in full and that is why I mentioned 2-3 years to pay it off. I have a good credit score and good rapport with all of my creditors. I always pay within my terms and more often then not pay my balances off prior to the due dates. For example I just recently paid off my car approx 6 months ahead of schedule.<br/> Borrower added on 08/25/10 > My fiance and I have been pre-approved for a home mortgage loan of up to 325k, but given that this is our 1st home we are shopping in the market of 225k and below which would keep us well under our budget and not be overwhelming. I am the co-borrower on the mortgage loan and my fiance is the primary borrower. Even with this newly aquired debt of the personal loan our income to debt ratio will not be drastically affected. Our current combined annual income exceeds 100k and our debt to income ratio w/o our current rent and with this new loan payment is at approx 16%. Our debt to income ratio with our current rent payment of $950.00 and this new loan payment is approx 24%. The ideal debt to income ratio that mortgage lenders and investors would like to see is at 36% and we are well below that with our combined income and debts. This loan combined with some of our savings would help cover our 3.5% down payment on our 30 Year Fixed FHA loan as well as the closing and moving cost.

One of the cards has an approximate balance of $9500.  I closed that account, which may have hurt my credit, but I will never have anything to do with Chase or any business affiliated with them.  At least not knowingly.  In four months time, from the time they took over the account from Washington Mutual, they raised my percentage rate twice, forced me to make two payments in one month, charged me a late fee and then reduced my credit limit, which was the final straw for me. The remaining amount of the loan will be placed into my savings account as part of my emergency fund. My significant other of 11 years lost his job a year ago in a reorganization.  He was fortunate to find another job, but for less pay.  Due to the economy, there is less work and the company has cut back on hours.  Since April of this year, his paychecks cover only child support.  I believe in keeping a savings account to cover at least 3-6 months of household expenses or as an emergency fund, which I have had to tap into during the past year.

My current take home is $2,185 (after tax) bi-weekly, so it's around $4,300 per month (after tax.)   I have been with my current employer for 2 years and have continuously been employed for 10 years with no gap.  I can fully document my current income by providing copies of paystubs or W2 to Lending Club.

To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day.<br/> Borrower added on 06/03/10 > In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.<br/><br/>Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 íëí¢í«_ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 íëí¢í«_ years.  During the 9 íëí¢í«_ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.

One of his credit cards alone has an interest rate of 23.99%. The balance on this particular card is 7500. We both have great jobs and recently took advantage of the housing market and purchased a home. We are able to make monthly payments on all our cards, but we are having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. One of our biggest challenges is the gasoline prices that continuously go up. My husband has been travelling 188miles per day to and from work spending approx. $140 per week on gas. This amounts to $560.00 per month sometimes more. He works as a deputy sheriff for one county, but we moved to another county(houses alot more reasonable in the county we currently live in). In order for him to work in the county we currently moved to, he would have to apply for the Sheriff's Dept. Unfortunately you can't transfer jobs between counties. In the meantime, he is living with relatives to save on gas so we can continue to pay our bills on time. He comes home on the weekends. We realize this is no way a family should live and make sacrifices especially when you have children. If approved, we will use the money to pay off our creditors and make one monthly loan payment.

On the low side my net income is $2810, I say low because I&rsquo;ve factored in missing 2-3 days incase of emergencies and incase no overtime/bonus  is given, my company currently allows unlimited OT due to my position and the demand for it.

We&rsquo;ve both committed to living with my parents (where I live currently) until we pay off the wedding.  The reason why I&rsquo;m able to bank the $1000 is because they do not charge me rent or make me pay for utilities or even food.  My cable bill is high because instead of going out all the time I spend it at home saving money.   I have over $40,000 in my retirement accounts so in a crunch I could always withdraw funds from them to pay back the loan.  I have been very responsible with my money but now need a little help to pay for the wedding.  My parents threw us an engagement party and our families gave us monetary gifts that totaled $5000 (which we still have and will pay for parts of the wedding), we&rsquo;ll receive at least the same in wedding gifts if not more. I choose the 5 year repayment to plan for the worst and should have no troubles paying this loan.  My credit history also reflects that I have an excellent payment history.    With this loan I would be able to pay for everything up front and not charge items to credit cards and even get discounts from wedding vendors if we pay cash.

I am responsible for the utility bills, and the grocery shopping. The only other debt I have, other than the aforementioned auto loan and credit cards, is a student loan of $18,000 that requires a monthly payment of $114.00 at an interest rat of 4.2%. I currently net $2000.00 per month. With this loan the consistent monthly payments I would have would include: $114.00 student loan; $203.00 lending club loan; $60.00 cell phone bill; ~$200.00 utilities & internet and $53.00 car insurance. Other common expenses include: ~$250.00 groceries and $80.00 gas. The reason I am sharing this with you, potential investor, is to assure you that I have the proper funds to repay you. I know if I was investing in a person I did not know, I would want as much information as possible.

I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000.

I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.

I have a stable career and have been in the same line of business since 2001.  During my college years I acquired multiple credit cards and sunk into debt.  I haven't had any late pays since early 2001.  I am the proud father of two children and husband to an amazing wife.  In 2004 my daughter broke her arm.  Due to problems with the insurance company I had at the time two collection accounts appeared on my credit file in 2005.  One for 97 dollars and another for 45.  Both have been paid off.  The first by the insurance company and the second by myself.  I have literally destroyed all of my credit cards and look forward to the day I can be free of all debt.  I thank you for helping me reach that goal and can assure you I have never defaulted on any loan.  ,debt consolidation,Path to freedom from credit card debt,760xx,TX,21.83,0.0,12/01/1993,2.0,61.0,,14.0,0.0,12025,37.2,21.0,f,0.0,3,PC1

2102,2103,Jet West Music Group Ltd,1,MORTGAGE,36000.0,not verified,n,"I am a well decorated, disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year.  Over the past year, with the assistance of the VA Vocational Rehabilitation program, I have invested over $100,000 in Operation: ROCK the HOUSE which is outlined below.  I did something similar while I was in the service in Germany.  Op: ROCK the HOUSE has a pretty tight timeline that doesnäóÁí_ŒÈt allow for intermittent delays (troops are returning everyday) like I have encountered in applying for a Patriot Express Loan. I am asking for $1,400 that will be used as working capital and operational expenses to continue the project until either my Patriot Express Loan or one of the other repayment scenarios comes through. 	 By investing so much, I ran up my credit cards to the point that my RLU has taken a toll on my standard 720 credit score.  Thus, a portion of this loan will be used to pay down the credit cards and improve my RLU.  Once I receive the Patriot Express Loan this loan will then be repaid in full. 	 The next several repayment scenarios involve the VA.  One, the VA VocRehab program reimburses me for the majority of my investment and this loan is paid off; two, the VA gets around to processing a VA disability claim I have in the neighborhood of $30,000 and this loan is paid off; or, three, and coincidentally the day my wife looks forward to the most, the VA finally processes another claim I have that amounts to roughly $75,000 in back-benefits and this loan is paid off.    Lastly, a large department store chain has asked to receive samples of our product line.  A portion of this loan will go toward having the samples manufactured.  The revenues from sells of the products will allow the loan to be serviced if not repaid entirely.  Of all the scenarios, this one is my favorite. 	 Thank you for your interest and hopefully your support.  Regardless, we look forward to seeing you during Op: ROCK the HOUSE.  Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is a äóÁí_íèHomecoming CelebrationäóÁí_Œù for service members by a service member. It lasts all summer long and is performed in three major acts. 	Act 1: May 5, 2009äóÁí_íñDrop date. The release of a unique compilation CD, that has notable artists performing songs written by disabled Army veteran, Jet West.   	OBJECTIVE: A theme song and äóÁí_íècelebration soundtrackäóÁí_Œù to provide a means of national identity, espirit de corps, and party music for a nation-wide celebration in honor of returning American troops.  	Act 2: May 23-25, Memorial Day WeekendäóÁí_íñShort Shots Leg 2, Short Shots, occurs as people across America shoot short video clips for the homecoming music video.  	OBJECTIVE: Embody the spirit of rebirth in the nation as it brings about new hope with new promise for all generations and celebrate the American military members who keep it possible.  	Act 3: September 4-7, Labor Day WeekendäóÁí_íñTrooptastic Finale Three days of concerts held simultaneously in three cities with performers rotating between cities.   	Active military and veterans admitted free with government-issued picture IDäóÁí_íñavailable free through the VA. Ticket prices set in inverse proportion to corporate sponsorship. Seeded with sales of the CD. 	OBJECTIVE: A national event to honor and celebrate the work of the military men and women who keep us free. 	Operation: ROCK the HOUSE is the brain child of disabled Army veteran and former Soldier of the Year, Jet West. Jet West Music Group Ltd is getting its start through the VA VocRehab program with financing made possible by LendingClub.com, the SBA Patriot Express Loan Initiative for veterans and, of course,  the thousands of contributors to Operation: ROCK the HOUSE. Jet West Music Group intends to use proceeds from these events to expand the entertainment options of service members stationed around the world far into the future starting with shows for the service members who missed Operation: ROCK the HOUSE.

The promotional rate of 0% is ending soon (in November); the rate will then jump up to 21.90%, retroactive to when we first purchased the windows. Originally, we had expected to take out a home equity loan to pay for the windows before the promotional rate ended. With the drop in our house's market value, the credit crunch, etc..., that is no longer a viable option. Plan ""B"" was to transfer the balance from the window credit card to an existing credit card that has more than enough available credit. Terms on this card are 8.874% APR, as long as we pay at least 5% of the balance each month (which we do). Unfortunately, that credit card company is not offering any balance transfer offers at the moment (surprise, surprise!), so Plan ""C"" is to use a convenience check from that credit card, which carries the cash advance terms of 16.453% APR, with a 3% fee (no cap). I decided to look into Lending Club as a potentially better Plan ""C"".  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit and have never missed or been late on a payment in almost 20 years of borrowing. I have a stable, secure, decent paying job. I have been with my current employer for only 1 year and 7 months, but have been in the same industry for 12 years, with only one previous employer (in this industry). The current amount we pay to the window credit card is $216 a month, which is easily manageable. The monthly payment for the Lending Club loan will be less than this amount.",credit card,Replacement Windows - High Rate Card,809xx,CO,19.36,0.0,05/01/1992,2.0,,,9.0,0.0,36976,53.1,26.0,f,0.0,2,PC1

My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.

I have only been late once on a bill to my credit card in 10 years and it was only because I posted it two days before the due date and forgot the due date was on a Sunday. I generally post my payments one to two weeks before the due date.  I made the mistake 3 years ago to do a cash transfer, thinking it transferred with the same interest rate of fixed interest rate of 9.9 %, and to my horror the interest was over 21%. My step-son was moving to our area to live with us, and I needed to come up with rent and deposit quickly since we lived in a small place at the time. I transferred $3000.00. I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing. I think you will find that I have excellent credit and hope to find a more reasonable rate for my debt. We very rarely use our credit card and only used it recently for a car repair of $1000.00 I applied for a different card recently to see if it would cover the cost, but am reluctant to use it and it doesn't cover enough to take care of the higher interest portion.

My thought is that (and I won't break down my bills in granular format) I could use an extra 500 to 1k a month and this is a good way to get that backstop.  Importantly, there is a time horizon on these large payments as my lovely ex-wife gets her last payment in 2014.

That being said, I'd much rather deal with this interest rate than my current CC rate (16.99%). If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask. I appreciate your help and look forward to being in your shoes soon. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > Lending Club, <br/>As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full.<br/>&bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? <br/>I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job.  <br/>My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road!<br/>My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. <br/>&bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? <br/>Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99%<br/>Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99%<br/>I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded.  <br/>&bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? <br/>Rent - $600 per month<br/>Car Payment - $206 per month<br/>The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc.<br/>&bull;	Monthly Budget <br/>Gross Income = $5,000 <br/>Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.)<br/>&bull;	My Plan (with your help!)<br/>Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up.  <br/>The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).  With a planned payment of $500 each month, I will have this completely paid off by September 2012 and then be in the position to help someone else out.
