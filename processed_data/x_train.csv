I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.   I have a base salary of $35,000 from the facility that I am based out of and had commissions paid in the amount of $6600 in January and $9000 in February. My gross income for 2007 was $85,000 with a base salary of $20,000 and commissions of $65,000 for the year.   If you notice on my credit report, I have not missed a payment on any debt. I wish to keep it that way and am looking for a loan to consolidate some of the monthly payments and reduce the total amount of my long-term debt.

I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.

Following acceptance of this loan I plan to cancel credit cards and start investments into an emergency fund. The additional $3,940 funds not existing within my revolving credit is my wife's unsecured debt. My wife is currently six months from completing her two year degree in Radiology which will increase our joint yearly income. The one delinquency mentioned was for a student loan that was setup to deliver all notifications online via the bank web site when logged into the account. As the lender did not know I was still in school and I was not regularly checking the online message center the account went 60 days without payment. Upon the first phone call from the lender I promptly paid the delinquent amount and completed necessary paperwork for the in-school deferment. As this was a mistake on my behalf, it was well learned to not let any of my revolving credit balances go un-noticed again.<br/>",debt consolidation,Student Debt Consolidation,820xx,WY,12.19,1.0,02/01/2001,0.0,7.0,,13.0,0.0,9410,72.4,25.0,f,0.0,3,PC4

We currently hold one residential rental property there (zip=46229) through Michelle Ryan Investments, LLC (my husband's LLC, a WA and IN registered LLC).  Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.  We coordinated all aspects of the renovation of the first rental property from right here WA.  The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???  How do we make sure we meet our Lendingclub obligation???  No problem at all.  We own our existing rental house, free and clear.  Because of that, net cash flow from it is more than enough to cover our monthly Lendingclub payment, in case we have to use that source.  As many families lost their precious homes to foreclosure, they are desperately searching for a house to rent.  This has increased the demand for rental houses.  We would like to help a family get a house.  To summarize, you as a Lendingclub lender have a very low risk and have a return that's unbelievably higher than that of banks.  So, please help us help you, everyone!  Please help us help a family that needs our help.  Let's find ourselves in a win-win-win situation!  Thank you for your interest in becoming our lender.

I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

This application, VinyasaMT, allows the user to manage projects and data from anywhere in the world. All you need is access to the Internet. The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base äóÁí_íÍ about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of FordäóÁí_ŒÈs approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement.

8902,8903,Cullum Constructors,1,RENT,30000.0,VERIFIED - income,n,"About me: I'm a young, ambitious, and excited student, father and future husband. The most important things in the world to me are my fiancee and her daughter, whose second birthday party I just had the pleasure of attending last month. I have a good job that I enjoy. I love to travel, speak foreign languages, and play the piano, and I'm a proud math/computer geek.  Purpose of loan: I'm finishing school! Since graduating high school in 03, I was a full-time student for two years, a half-time student in Germany for one semester, and part-time or no-time for the rest. Part of the reason is financial, part of it is personal, but all of it is behind me and I'm ready to commit to a non-stop trip to Diploma Town.  And I want you to come with me! I don't want this to be an impersonal ""you give me money, I say thanks and make payments"" kind of thing. I want you to get to know me, and see what your money is doing! Through a blog I promise to update regularly, you'll get to see the positive impact you're having on me and my family, and I'll also be happy to share news of my academic performance so you can see you're not throwing the money away on some loser. Maybe we could even turn this from just an investment into a friendship. By funding this loan, you are saving me from working 80 hours a week, giving me time to focus equally on my job and education, with plenty left over for my family.  I have just been accepted as a transfer student to the University of Illinois at Springfield, to pursue a B.A. in Mathematical Sciences. I will need 49 credit hours to finish. By my calculation, the total cost will be approximately $12,500 including books and fees, of which I am seeking 30% with this loan. I will be beginning in June with a scheduled completion in May 2010.  My goal is to break into the actuarial profession. If you're unfamiliar with it, actuaries are basically paid very well (often six figures) to predict the future--that is, calculate risk, particularly associated with insurance. It's a very important, but reportedly very low-stress profession. The latter is critical to me, because I want to spend as much time as possible with my family.  My financial situation: My fiancee and I both work full-time. I have a well-paying job as an entry-level manager for a construction company, and she's a barista (caffeine dealer). Our expenses are low for our area--we live in a duplex and both of our cars were pretty used when we got them. She takes care of most of the cost of food as well as diapers and such. I pay the bills, as you'll see below, except for rent, which is split between us. Although money from both sources will be probably be used to pay back this loan, and some cuts will be made from the budget listed below, I have listed only my own income and itemized my spending as of now.  My relatively weak credit score is a reflection of my high debt-to-income ratio, caused by a Stafford loan and a couple of credit cards to which my medical equipment and a trip to visit family in Philadelphia were recently charged, as well as a signature loan we used to fund our recent move and a mass of doctoräóÁí_ŒÈs bills and auto repairs from last year.

I run an Internet marketing company and I am seeking funds to help launch my latest and greatest project, a Chicago community website.  Funds will mostly be used for web development work and initial marketing expenses.  The website will make money from network sponsorships. Due to our already established local connections we already have many paying clients lined up waiting for the website to launch. These payments will be significantly higher then our monthly loan repayment which will allow us to pay the loan off early.  We estimate the loan will be paid off in full in 12-16 months. We consider this a safe loan because even if the business is a complete flop (not likely!) I have an existing income stream from other websites that will more then cover the payments with no hassle. Payments will be automatic and always on time. I am also investing a great deal of my own cash into this project, so I have complete faith in the business.

The last two months I've been scrambling trying to get rid of my balance on this card, because the promo period ended.

I tried to transfer most of it to another card with available credit, but they denied my request. I also applied to receive a new American Express card for the intention of transferring the balance, but even though I was accepted, I was again refused the balance transfer. All my transfering and paying off my other high APR cards, lowered my credit score. But I have had good credit all my life, paying all my bills on time.

I am a single woman with a good job and own a home in Arizona. The condition of the housing market in AZ is dismal and hence I cannot obtain a home equity loan to pay this debt off. I have been working for my current employer for 4 years and feel confident that my job is secure. 8 years ago I had to declare bankruptcy due to my husband's suicide. He left me with an enormous amount of debt. However, since his passing in 1999, I have purchased 2 homes.   I am hoping that you will grant me this personal loan. None of my credit accounts (including my home) have been paid late. I have just let this debt get out of control and need to eliminate it all together.

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.

I use credit cards only for online purchases, flights, or major purchases.  Unfortunately, I have had to make several major purchases over the past year.  I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.

I believe in addition to my stability with my job and good credit that the biggest reason I am a good borrower is my integrity and character. I believe in following through on my words and promises. I have strong Christian values and I believe in doing the right thing even when it is not the easiest thing.

I am a good candidate for this loan because I have over come some really major hurtles in the past 8 years; divorce & relocation to another state by myself and have been able to stay afloat (meeting all financial commitments).  Unfortunately, my äóÁí_íèDäóÁí_Œù credit rating is a result of difficulties  during those years of  the divorce & relocation.  I have made steady fiscal progress with each passing year.  My last big hurtle to reaching my goal of financial freedom is eliminating lingering bad debt.  No longer do I utilize credit cards to live!  When I moved to my current state of residence I accepted a state government job for $9.00/hr and no benefits in hopes of äóÁí_í‡making something happenäóÁí_ŒÈ with my life.  Within two months I had a position on the regular payroll with benefits and have progressed from that entry level position into a management position.  I am now one of the äóÁí_í‡go to galsäóÁí_ŒÈ for others in my professional community because of my integrity and experience in our field.  Presently I am paying a mortgage and assisting my husband with our mutual debt and repayment of  my old closed accounts which we took out a loan for 2 years ago. This loan is scheduled to be paid off by April 2009. Each month we sit down and pay the bills and we see no progress, other than just keeping current.  We would like to be able to one day help others in need and to do that we need to clear this debt up.  By combining these payments into one, perhaps a bit lower and certainly a lower interest rate, payment we could realize this dream.  I am hoping that someone out there is willing to provide me with the opportunity to continue to realize success and achieve future dreams and to continue the Lending Club cycle of helping others.    Monthly net income: $4100 (includes HusbandäóÁí_ŒÈs of $1800) Monthly expenses:   Housing: $ 1300.00 Health Insurance: $ 200.00 Car expenses: $385 Fuel and Car Insurance Utilities: Water/Power: $200 Phone, cable, internet: $130 Food, entertainment: $500.00-600.00 food for packed lunchs, dinners and one night out a month Clothing, household expenses $ 20-30 Credit cards and other loans: $ 1300+/- Other expenses: Monthly diabetic prescriptions & supplies  Please ask me any questions you may have.

My debt started to jump as soon as I had to move out of my ex's house. Even though my apartment rent isn't that huge, once you start buying groceries and paying bills, you get backed up, especially if you don't have the money to begin with. I have just gotten to a point where I pay so much on many little bills that keeping up is getting impossible. I needed a way to get all my bills into one without screwing up my credit like most consolidation loans do. I have about 11,000 in credit card debt, 5-6,000 in student loans, 3,000 in medical bills, and a 12,000 car loan. 18,000 was the highest I could get so whatever I can pay off will help tremendously. Obviously I need to pay my credit card debt because the interest rates are high, even higher than 16%. After that, I need to put the rest towards my other bills. I feel like such a failure, I am an educated woman with a masters degree and the fact that I could get myself into this much trouble makes me sick. I barely sleep at night thinking about how I can help myself get out of this. <br/><br/>Any help would be appreciated more than you know.

9605,9606,24 Hour Fitness,1,RENT,20000.0,not verified,n,"My name is Chris and I live in Austin, Texas.  IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈve done since last December after getting out of school.  IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm a hard worker, and IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I doníëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈt have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, IíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈm willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave RamseyíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈs Financial Peace University course.  In case youíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈre not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where íëŒ¢í«í_í«íèevery dollar is spent before the month begins.íëŒ¢í«í_í«Œù  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.",small business,I just need a chance,787xx,TX,10.32,0.0,06/01/2005,1.0,,,4.0,0.0,3688,97.1,6.0,f,0.0,3,PC3

I am currently attending a two year maritime University in Seattle Washington.  The company that I work for Sause Bros. hired me to go to this Institute and to work out at sea on their tug boats. The school is called Pacific Maritime Institute.(PMI)  I am attending the school to obtain my Mates 500-1600 tons oceans and near coastal license.  I have to finance the schooling myself though and I have financed half of the tuition so far, and have been enrolled for one year.  I still have the remainder of the tuition to pay for and that is why I am requesting this loan. I am payed while out at sea and while I am on land in class: and after I complete the course and receive my license, the full tuition will be given back to me over a period of three years. Also after completing school within the next year I will earn mate wages of around $70-85,000.00 a year.  I love the sea and I love this new carrier I just need a little help to cover schooling right now. Hope this might answer a few questions you might have had if you have any more please let me know.

This is the perfect business investment loan to invest in for many reasons:<br/>1.  Managing a DVD Now Kiosk does not require me to quit my full-time job.<br/>2. DVD Kiosks are growing faster than any other vending opportunity in the market today.<br/>3. DVD Now competes with Red Box by offering Blue Ray and video games, which Red Box does not offer. Also Red Box only works with large chains like Wal-Mart.  My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch.<br/>4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.  Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.  With a Red Box Kiosk, every time a customer rents a DVD, Blue Ray Disk, or Video Game, they are presented with the option to purchase.  Also DVD Now provides advertising space on their kiosks, which provides the kiosk owner with a steady monthly stream of income.<br/>",small business,DVD Now Kiosk,244xx,VA,9.26,0.0,12/01/2002,0.0,30.0,,5.0,0.0,27265,64.5,10.0,f,0.0,2,PC2

I begged them to loan me the money because I knew it would help me tremendously with repaying my high intrest rate credit card debt I had accumulated through college and before landing my job after graduation. They finally agreed to finance the loan for $10,000 at 14.99%! Just below my lowest credit card APR at the time. It was disapointing to me because I have such a good credit score.

I spent the winter restoring the interior and all it needs now is this engine rebuild.   Having the engine overhauled boosts the airplanes value from it's current $20k market value to around $30-$32k and makes it more fuel efficient and reliable.  Once the airplane is flying again, I plan of flying it for various charitable missions, including Angel Flight, Young Eagles and Pilots n Paws (animal rescue). Flying is my passion and I like to apply this passion in a way that I can help others!  I recently relocated back to MA, am college degreed with 20+ years career experience. I recently accepted a new job in the medical device industry, and have a decent income ($90k/year) going forward, but living expenses while out of work, plus necessary move costs incurred to get myself here have depleted my current cash reserves.  Based on my new job income ($7500/mo) , I will be in a position to pay off my current credit cards and service this loan without any difficulty, in fact, if they provided shorter terms, I'd gladly pay off in  just 4 months. but am OK with carrying this loan out to it's 36 month (3 year) term. Longer term, I am looking to eventually buy real estate (condo or starter house)    Time is of the essence! The engine rebuilders in PA already have the airplane engine in their shop now and I need these funds to get the 4 week remanufacturing cycle started. They need $6k down and the balance upon delivery. I will have the funds (through future pay checks) to cover the aircraft mechanics fees to reinstall engine when it's done.

My responsibilities continue to grow as I bring in new accounts and expand our offerings. My fiance secured a job in management at a sporting goods store with a national retail company in February, and is eager to make a name for himself here. We are both hardworkers and come from similar backgrounds that stress that. <br/><br/>I bought my condo 3 1/2 years ago - and the housing market as taken a hit. We plan to live here for at least two to three more years to be able to be in a better position with the mortgage. Due to the market drop, a home equity loan is not an option.<br/><br/>We feel we are a good borrower because we have recognized the mistakes we made, and are not happy that we put ourselves in this position. We have been trying for the past few months to get a handle on our debt, but feel we can best do this with a personal loan that can help us better manage our payments, and eventually put us in a position to start saving. Not that we were not before, but are now moreso very careful with our money.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to help us pay off a good number of our credit cards, as well as pay the remaining balance due on our wedding. If we knew now what we knew last summer, maybe we would have approached our wedding differently. But hindsight is 20-20, so now we are just trying to get our finances on the right track. <br/><br/>We know that the monthly payment we take on, if our loan is fully funded, will represent 12% of our monthly income -- and this would help put us in a much better position that we stand right now.<br/> Borrower added on 07/29/10 > We appreciate the investments to date.

I have been paying out about 3000+ each month just for debt, rent and bills for the past two years.

I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding.  <br/>Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.  I think this will really save on gas money.  Also, I just think that riding on the open road (helmet for me of course), would be a great stress reliever.  I really just need to feel less stress..., feel happy, and feel normal again.<br/><br/>Thank you for all of you that look at this and help.  I could really use this for so many reasons right now.  I hope it will happen.  <br/><br/>Thank you all in advance.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Seth B.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank everyone so much.  If  I am fortunate enough to obtain this loan, it will be used for a bike.

I hope this is able to come through soon.<br/><br/>Best Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank you all so much.  I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.  I appreciate all of your help.  Thank you, and best regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/21/10 > Thank you everyone that has helped so far.  I really appreciate it.  I just wanted to let it be known that I will have additional medical expenses for myself that would also need to be covered by this.  This will help with costs, and fees that the hospital would normally add on, but will then take away from the &quot;stress relief&quot;/'fun money&quot;.  (It is more important for me to get bills taken care of than to purchase a bike as a post divorce stress-reliever, even though I think it would have assisted me with some other issues I am currently dealing with.

I'm currently an associate at a middle market investment bank making $75,000 per year.

Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner.

I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years.

The card had nearly $40,000 on it at one point and it's down to $18,000. It is in my Grandmother's name because my dad lost a job 15 years back that ruined his credit and she offered the card to them. They have never missed a payment. It is their number 1 financial priority. They are going to continue to pay the note. My Grandmother's nerves just can't handle the card being in her name anymore so this is the solution to get it out of her name.

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

Prior to turning 17 I worked part time from the age of 13.  I held my first real job at a Market Research firm for 10 years.  I worked my way up from telemarketer to Marketing Director eventually landing in Honolulu HI running a branch office.  When that office closed, I went to work for Nextel Communications and was a Customer Relations Manager for about 2 years before moving to CA.  Since living in CA I have had 2 jobs, the first as Operations Manager for an IT Outsourcing company (2 years) and most recently as a Data Analyst with a Telecom Expense Management firm where I have been employed for the past 2.5 years.  There are no gaps in my employment history and I have never been without a job.   I currently have 8 debtors, which includes 7 credit cards at decent interest rates and a small line of credit for overdraft protection.  I have paid off a home mortgage, and 6-8 auto loans with no late payments or fees.  I have never bounced a check, missed a payment, or had any liens against me.  The only issue with my credit report is the credit cards for which I am seeking this loan to pay off, all of which are up to date and in good standing.  My take home pay is about $3K a month.  I have monthly expenses of about $1815($800 rent, $200 car payment, $65 insurance, $150 utilities, currently paying $600+ on credit cards).  My goal is to pay off my credit cards and close all but one of them with this loan.  The remaining credit card I plan on making $150 payments on until paid off.  I would like to purchase another home in 4-5 years once this debt is paid up.  I do have access to family funds and a second income from my partner in the event of any emergencies.  I also have $6K in savings to fall back on.  I am very proud of my credit and payment history and would never do anything to damage my credit.  The majority of this credit card debt was accrued 10+ years ago and I am currently living well within my means.  My problem is that since I have such a large amount of credit card debt banks will not issue me a consolidation loan despite my flawless payment history.

1602,1603,READINGTON FARMS,8,MORTGAGE,74000.0,VERIFIED - income,n,"  Borrower added on 09/24/11 > Hi, I am looking for a loan to get out of credit card debt.   I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.  Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for helping.<br/>",debt consolidation,HELP! CREDIT CARD DEBT HAS A HOLD ON ME!,180xx,PA,19.05,0.0,03/01/1994,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,15506,68.3,21.0,f,0.0,2,PC3

Meaning there is no possible way of me being laid off or let go.

During the past two years since the Great Hurricane Rita Evacuation in Houston, Texas. I developed a pressure wound on my right buttock, shortly after the evacuation. Pressure wounds grow from the inside outwards. With my Spina Bifida Disability I'm confined to a wheelchair. I am fully independent but at 35 years old its time to ask for an assistants help. I do not have full sensation in this area of the wound. A normal drive to Dallas from Houston is 4 hours, during this evacuation it took me 29 hours. During driving long distances in vehicles its difficult to perform needed very often pressure lifts/reliefs. I had this pressure wound operated on Sept. 12, 2006 after staying flat on my back one month in the hospital I went home two weeks later it opened up again. I also had Osteomyelitis & MRSA it was treated with PICC Line IV antibiotics for the duration of those six weeks. Nov. 13, 2007 I'm back in the hospital again I had 2 (Nov.13th&16th) procedures of debridement the bone of infection. No MRSA was located this time thank God. I am once again on a PICC line for the next 2 weeks while I'm recovering from a 3rd (Nov. 21st) procedure muscle flap this wound is closed. (Dec.17) I had a 4th procedure to close an abscess. This started the healing process back from scratch. Two more weeks from today I can try sitting. I had this same procedure in 1992; in total I have had 47 surgeries. My business is my escape from all the procedures. With this loan it would give me the cushion I need to work at a pace until I'm 100% healed again. My financial situation: I have two major RACING clients one of them called me the day of my 3rd surgery, which happen to be the day before Thanksgiving. This client I have a contract for around 13K with a balance of 8K left on that contract over the next few years. I have a similar contract coming up starting in early 2008 which will be similar through summer of 2009 this contract will have lots of travel involved also. The main reason as you can tell I am a trooper and never say never to a challenge. My gross income has risen 15K in 2007. I have steady monthly clients good for at least $3000. I just need that extra financial cushion to help the lives of other persons who are disabled.

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.

I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.

899,900,Tighe Patton Armstrong Teasdale,8,MORTGAGE,131000.0,not verified,n,"I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",small business,Partnership Bridge Loan,220xx,VA,15.16,0.0,05/01/1987,0.0,33.0,,8.0,0.0,134025,67.9,16.0,f,0.0,3,PC4

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>",debt consolidation,Axing the APR,941xx,CA,16.8,0.0,12/01/1990,0.0,,,9.0,0.0,49692,89.3,22.0,f,0.0,3,PC1

I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA. However, not many banks are willing to lend to a business where the main source of revenue is the sale of tobacco, even more a startup.  We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.

My financial situation:  I have a full time job as a finacial consultant with a well funded company.    My living expenses are well below my total income and my investment in this business venture will only go to strengthen my financial position.  I have never been late on one payment in 10 years since I first established my credit. The financial risk of this investment is limited to my investment of $25,000 and the rest of the financing is in place from the other partners so that the certainty that the project will reach completion is already assured. The  return on investment is projected to be 9% in the first year after my debt serrvice but jumps to 12%-15%  in the second and third years. Since this is a long term investment the negative return for the first few years is justified as it will be positive once the loan is repaid.  Also,  t he probability of additonal sites opening and  being funded by the existing  operations will increase the future returns and more than be worth the tax deductible interest for this loan that I am asking you to fund.

I would move the $4,500 in credit debt to that card which guarantees a 3% rate on balance transfers for 5 years.   I would then use a Lending Club loan to pay of my current line of credit with the bank and pay down some of the vehicle loan.  And then because of the new zero balance on the bank line of credit the remainder of the vehicle loan could be transferred to that line of credit.

Background Information<br/><br/>I graduated from college in 12-2006<br/>with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics/Computers. I have also taken<br/>actuarial exams in order to be further my career as an actuary. During<br/>college I ended up getting married and having a son. Going to school<br/>fulltime, and taking care of my family resulted in my accumulation of credit<br/>card debt. While my debt was building the interest rates were in the mid<br/>single digit range, so I wasn't careful enough with the use of the credit<br/>cards. Even as late as last February my rates were so low that instead of<br/>paying off my debt, I used the money I had saved for a down payment on my<br/>house. I've also used savings to pay off student loans instead of my credit<br/>cards. Now that my credit card companies have severely increased my rates,<br/>the balance grows more and more each month. I've never missed or been late<br/>with payments on any bills. I have a lot of recent inquiries on my credit<br/>report because I have recently purchased a used car and compared quotes from<br/>many different companies. Also, for the past month I have been actively<br/>searching for ways to consolidate my credit card debt.<br/><br/>II. Employment Information<br/><br/>I work for Producers Incorporated located in Central Florida. I'm an actuarial<br/>analyst and help manage the sales, administration, and customer service<br/>departments for the company. The company has 35-40 employees and I work<br/>directly with the owner overseeing all areas of the business. The company<br/>sells various insurances and investments.

Before that happens I want to see if you would qualify me for a loan so I can throw my cuurent credit card debt which is now about 800.00 monthly, into 1 payment with a fixed monthly payment and for a set length of time instead of paying forever. I promise you will not regret giving me the opportunity to become a client of yours.

However, within the last couple of months, 3 of these credit cards have increased their interest rates criminally.  I've requested rate reductions directly and can't get any cooperation despite my very good credit history.  It feels like I'm now trying to fill a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom.

I have a stable, management position with a very good salary and remain 1000% committed to achieving credit-card debt-free life, as I have two kids to send to college soon within the next few years.

The legal job market has been particularly difficult to break into (even the Harvard, Yale and Stanford kids are having trouble), but after nearly a year of searching, I have landed firmly in a fantastic position with seemingly endless room for growth, and a more-than-decent starting salary.  I have paid off about $5k toward my debt in the past 4 months, however a large percentage of that money went toward interest.  My average APR is somewhere near 26 percent, though I have not missed a payment in more than four years.  I am wholeheartedly committed to paying down this debt in full within the coming 36 months.

Thank you for having faith in me.<br/> Borrower added on 05/04/10 > In an attempt to make this process as easy as possible, I have read through many current loan applications that are undergoing funding.  I've found that lenders often would like to know the names, balances, and APRs of cards that borrowers intend to pay down/pay off with the loan funds received from LendingClub.  To that end, I have placed that information below.<br/><br/>LENDER    BAL     APR      MIN PYMT   Time to Pay off@ MIN PYMT<br/>Discover $4,425 @29.99 -  minimum $134 - 18 years <br/>Chase    $5,725  @20.24 - minimum $154    28 years<br/>GM Card $10,727 @ 22.90 - minimum $311  29 years<br/>MBNA (BoA) $4,918 @26.24 minimum $153   25 years<br/><br/>The total of my minimum payments on these cards is currently $752.  I *always* pay at least this much, but sometimes more.  For example, I paid an extra $2000 toward the above-referenced Discover card in February.  In response, Discover (understandably) accepted the money and reduced my credit line by $2k.  <br/><br/>The new payment on the loan I am seeking from LendingClub would be under $900 per month.  In just THREE years, I will have paid off 95 percent of the four loans found above.  This will be accomplished simply by paying $150 per month above my current minimums!  3 Years through LendingClub vs. 20+ years through the credit card companies is a ""no-brainer"" for me.  <br/><br/>One last thing I would like to mention.  I have noticed that LendingClub members often worry that a prospective borrower will pay off the loan ahead of schedule.  At this time, it is my intention to take the full 36 month term to pay off the loan I am seeking.  If I receive substantial raises over the next two years, I might then decide to accelerate repayment.  Full Disclosure =)  Thank you again.<br/> Borrower added on 05/05/10 > Edited to add:  My loan payment--if granted--from LendingClub will actually only be $832/month.  This is just $80 more than my current monthly minimums as described above.  I had previously stated I would be paying $150 per month above my current monthly minimums, so this makes the LendingClub loan option even more advantageous!<br/> Borrower added on 05/07/10 > I have just submitted my pay stub and employment verification information to LendingClub Home Office.

So now I want to pay off, or down, the credit cards in order to get the mortgage.  I could also use a hard money lender with the house as collateral, and the lender being the mtg holder, but they ask too high a rate, and my credit is good I shouldn't have to pay loan shark interest!

I recently purchased a new personal residence that I used most of my free cash to acquire.  I came across a great real estate deal that I want to complete.  In the past, hard money lenders would simply lend on investment properties based on the loan to value but now the hard money lenders want you to put up a down payment as well.  That brings me to Lending Club.  The terms through Lending Club allow me to still meet my investment parameters so I figured I would give it a try.  The loan will be used as the downpayment for an investment property that I am going to repair and resell.  The property is in the Petworth area of Washington, DC.  The purchase price is $160,000 and the repairs are estimated at $55,000 with a $5,000 contingency ($60,000 total repair estimate) for a total of $220,000 (62% of value) to acquire and fix up the property.  The after repair value of the property is $355,000 which is conversative.  My hard money lender looked at the deal and immediately said it was solid.  The hard money is lined up but the lender requires that I have some ""skin in the game"" in this environment so he wants me to put down $20,000 as a downpayment.  I am able to pay $5,000 and I am looking for a loan to pay the rest.

I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.

A place thriving of independent film makers, production companies, and film studios.  I currently am employed at a job that I have been at for 3 years now.   I am still in the development stages of my business, I have invested 10K of my money from my current job to help build the business (i.e. permit, registrations, equipment, storage)  This is a new business venture for me that I am seeking,  I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on equipment rental's to draw in customers, and also I have 3 years experience as an Independent film maker as well so I know exactly what products are in high demand, and what products are not.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am very familiar with what equipment customers are in high demand of, and 2, I can produce the lowest rates on rentals to attract new customers to my business.  At my current job, I work evenings, so I plan to work both until my business takes off and shows signs of stability (i.e. 12 months of generating profitable income)  With a 10K loan, I will be able to purchase the sufficient ammount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.  The projected annual gross income of this business with the 10K loan is estimated at $21,350, which is based on my current inventory list, and price per item, per month (documentation for this estimate can be provided if requested.)  For the first 1-2 years, my plan is to take all gross profits and 1st, repay any loan(s), and 2nd to invest back into my business to further expand my inventory and reach my goal of doubling my income from year one, and tripling my income for year 3 of business.  With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas. If for some reason, this business venture does not work out.  The loan can easily be repayed from my current primary job that I have been at for the last 3 years, as I do not plan on quitting that job, until either/or, the loan is repayed, or after a year, the business is still generating a profitable return, and showing signs of stability.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your inquiry in my business venture.<br/>Kelly.<br/> Borrower added on 05/25/10 > With this loan I am requesting, I will be able to purchase the sufficient amount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.

9050,9051,LPL Financial,2,RENT,40000.0,not verified,n,"This loan will be used to paydown business debt from my early 20s.  My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

I currently have three credit cards ($8400, 4200, and $600 balances). I would like to consolidate these debts into one payment for convenience as well as to maximize APR once promotional rate expires on these accounts.  My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!). I currently work as a paralegal and make $36,000 per year before OT, but also cater for added income, and I am very simple with my spending. I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.  My monthly budget: Salary: $2700.00 per month Mortgage/rent: $280.00 (I live with friends so rent is very cheap) Insurance: $56.00 Car expenses: $89.00 (use public transportation in Boston at $89.00 per month for train pass) Utilities: $100.00 (not part of rental agreement. Rent is one flat fee) Food, entertainment: $160.00 Clothing, household expenses $100.00 Credit cards and other loan payments: $465.00 (3 credit cards 3.99%, 12.99% and 0%) Other expenses: $39.99  Overall, I feel I am great investment, with a simple request.

1624,1625,here! Networks,5,RENT,53307.0,not verified,n,"Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.

I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

1699,1700,"Cain Brothers & Co., LLC",1,MORTGAGE,95000.0,not verified,n,"Help me take the last steps out of financial hardship, and into becoming a lender.  Forgive a long explanation, but I want to give a complete picture to those who consider loans individually.   The past:  I bought my home with a very low-down-payment loan. It's a two-family with good rental income ($1150) in a good location äóÁí_íÍ walking distance to midtown-direct train to NY.  The loan terms were not favorable looking out a few years, but I expected to be able to refinance my way out before it got bad. I was working as an IT manager and my credit record was steadily improving. Unfortunately, my company's parent company sold us, and I was laid off in the process.   I took a chance and tried to go into private consulting with a partner. Without going into detail, the partnership didn't work - we hardly made money. We broke up, and I was left with his share of six months' expenses, which I had covered.  I also had to deal with the eviction of a bad tenant and the associated financial pain.  Meanwhile, my $300k 1st mortgage rate climbed to 8%, nearly as high as my equity loan ($33k at 9%). I focused on keeping the mortgage payments current, which meant I made some hard (bad?) decisions to get by, including running up credit card debt, delaying payments, and becoming late on my property taxes (which were not escrowed.)  Of course, I also went back to work in the corporate world as an IT Manager.   Now, the present.  I have been 1.5 years working as an IT Manager in Manhattan äóÁí_íÍ I'm in a stable position with a good firm and salary. I got current and then paid down tens of thousands in debt, starting with the highest rate, intending to improve my credit score while establishing a current salary history so I could refinance.  I just recently entered an arrangement with my 1st mortgage holder, who adjusted the rate to 5.5% fixed for 5 years (variable after) and covered the back taxes. They also paid my taxes forward 12 months, resulting in a $29k escrow deficit.  Then I set about getting an equity loan for $62k to cover the existing $33k loan and the $29k escrow deficit. It is not a good time for equity loans!  Banks have raised equity requirements, and have raised FICO requirements for high LTV loans. Though my score has risen to the 700 range, they want 740 for very high LTV. At the same time, my appraisal has come back lower than expected. I'm not worried about the current value äóÁí_íÍ I plan to stay here for many years. But it does mean that it's simply impossible to refinance the equity loan now.  This leaves me with three alternatives.  1. Payment program with my 1st mortgage holder where the $29k deficit is paid back over 12 monthly payments. I can do this, but it would be a financial stretch, and I would expect to end the 12 months with \more credit card debt.  2. Refinance the entire home. In the current market, this means high fees and many points just to get a rate of 7%. While this lowers my monthly payments, the terms are so bad that I'd rather deal with the first option.  3. Get a personal loan to help spread the $29k out over more than 12 months, bringing me here.  This $24k loan will be used to pay off the bulk of the $29k escrow deficit - the deficit to be spread out over the next 12 months as an addition to my normal escrow payments.  I expect to be able to pay off my remaining credit card while paying off the escrow deficit. After that, my plan is to:  1. Pay down my Lending Club loan aggressively.  2. Max out my FSA and 401k contributions.  3. Become a lender with Lending Club, bringing me full cycle from borrower to lender.

This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>",debt consolidation,DebtCon,980xx,WA,9.84,1.0,02/01/1987,0.0,11.0,,9.0,0.0,35061,94.2,30.0,f,0.0,1,PC4

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

After such a extended period of unemployment, and despite several major cuts in our living expenses, the savings we had two years ago have been exhausted, and although this move would mean a much more secure financial home for us and our two young children, we don't have the capital to pay for our move.<br/><br/>If this posting looks familiar, it is because it already has been posted.  There was a mistake on my credit repot that caused the credit department to remove the loan.  After discovering the error, I fixed it and we are now trying this process again.  The original request was for $7500, but since that posting, we have had money come in from an unexpected source, so we are able to drop the amount of the loan.<br/><br/>We now have the rental truck paid for along with our estimated costs for hotel, food, and gas.  What this money would be used for is the associated costs of setting up our new home.  We have an apartment reserved for us, but we need to pay a deposit on it as well as possible deposits on utility services.  We will also need to buy groceries to restock the pantry and refrigerator.  In addition, there will be approximately a 3-week gap between when my paychecks from my old job end and when my first paycheck from my new position arrives.  That last &quot;old&quot; paycheck will pay the rent for the month, but not any of the other living expenses of the month.<br/><br/>Please consider helping us with our situation!  I have never defaulted on a financial obligation in my life, even when I had to make sacrifices to fulfill my responsibilities, and you will get every penny of your money back, plus your interest.

About 5 years ago I was still moving up in the company I work for. My husband was laid off in his job with an adverstising firm. We had a lot of school loans, credit card debt, etc. When we were younger we did not make the best decisions on purchases and spending. Like a lot of young people, we had lots of credit card debt and were in over our heads. We could make payments on the credit cards when we were both working, though we were not making a lot of headway in paying them down. Then when my husband lost his job we took on more debt just to stay afloat. We missed a lot of payments. <br/>Over the last 5 years I have moved up in my job and now make around $90,000 a year. My husband makes between $55,000 and $75,000, depending on the amount of overtime he gets during the year. In the last few years my husband and I have dug ourselves out of over $80,000 in debt. <br/>All we have now is a house payment at $1,100/15 years, his truck payment $360/month 2 1/2 years remaining, and an old personal loan $157/month &ndash; matures 2014 at 8%. <br/>It has just been in this last year that we finally got to this point. Then this happens. I don&rsquo;t have the $12,000+ saved up to fix the small flood in my front yard. (I asked for $14,000 as I will have to have my walk path re-poured and don&rsquo;t know exactly how much that will cost.) I really can&rsquo;t wait another 6-8 months to save the money to get this fixed. I really need to get it fixed in the next few weeks before it gets really bad. <br/>I can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I do not want to take on this loan. I don&rsquo;t want to be back in debt but do not have a choice. We have checked with several banks and they will lend us the money, since we have such great income. But because of all of the past debt we had where we were late on our payments (when my husband had no job and I was only making around $35,000 a year) they want to loan it to us at 23-25%. If that is my only choice I will have to accept it. But, my husband encouraged me to give it a few days and try this site since the interest rate is lower. I am very nervous about getting a loan in this manner but he says &ldquo;have faith&rdquo; and see what this brings.

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

Consolidating the loans would lower our monthly payments as well as allowing us to divert that extra money towards child care costs, and perhaps also towards building our emergency fund which we had greatly neglected for the longest time.<br/>The new plan now is to pay off unsecured debt, build up our emergency fund and hopefully still have extra cash to put into another investment while still living comfortably within our means, especially with the new addition to our family.<br/> Borrower added on 01/28/10 > To answer other potential questions:<br/><br/>Monthly bills: 1820 for mortgage, 370 for HOA, about 150 for cable/internet, 150 for a family cell phone plan, about 145 for school loans (took some additional classes for Accounting certification), about 40 to 100 for electricity (depending on the season). <br/><br/>Credit card balances/interest rates are as follows:<br/>Citi - 4,562.22 @ 14.990<br/>Amex - 2,042.24 @ 15.210<br/>Wells Fargo - 1,918.61 @ 6.65 (just want to pay this balance off already)<br/>*Have other balances on department store cards which I am paying off separately this month, totalling approximately $800.<br/><br/>I have a spouse but we chose to keep our finances (and debt) separate except for the mortgage, HOA, phone bill and property tax.

4780,4781,Pixsy Corporation,1,RENT,55000.0,VERIFIED - income,n,"LOAN PURPOSE  This loan will be used by my business partner and I to buy an under-valued, under-nourished existing business.  BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash.

I own my car free and clear and purchased a home several years ago. I've held a steady job for many years with the same school district I graduated from long ago. Alas, the credit card debt from my youth is still around to haunt me.

I've never been late on a payment, credit card or otherwise, and I've learned the hard way about money management.

The dealer and I are in a panic because of the following reasons -  1)  They took the old car in trade, paid off the loan, and have transferred the title and sold it.  2)  I am having a real hard time getting financing from anyone due to this economy and due to the rental property I own.  3) The title has been transferred to my name now, and as far as the state is concerned, the car is legally mine.   I am 28 years old, about to be married, already have one child, and just found out I got another one coming.  I pay ALL my bills on time, and don't have that many.  I own a 4 family rental home that has solid renters, and the rents pay my mortgage on the rental building.  I live in one of the units. Due to the mortgage I have, the banks are screaming about my debt to income ratio, which due to the rents, should not be an issue, but apparently it is.  They can't seem to understand that I don't pay for the mortgage.  I own an LLC that my rental business is operated under, I work 6 days a week at a bank call center.  My rental business is a 2 man operation, involving myself and my Dad.   My soon-to-be wife works at a call center at a bank as well, works 5 days a week.   We have no problems paying all our bills.   I am trying everything I can to make this loan issue go away and prevent it from turning into an even bigger mess than it already is.  The dealer has tried everything they can think of, and I have too, and we both have run out of ideas.  The car is a 2001 BMW X5.

Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.

I am trying to avoid this and save my credit among everything else. The bank has alloted me extra time due to the fact that I have made a sincere effort in resolving this issue. I am due another check from a claim, but will not receive that until February and the bank will not wait that long. Please rest assure that I plan to pay back every penny no matter what I have to do. I came here hoping that I could receive help and in return I will indeed sign up to help others. For all who have helped me thus far, I thank you for your trust and I promise if you all help me, this loan will be paid off in 6 months and not 3 years.<br/>",other,NewBeginning,357xx,AL,0.31,0.0,10/01/1998,1.0,65.0,,6.0,0.0,391,7.2,29.0,f,0.0,2,PC1

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve CornellíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wifeíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We doníëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈt own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wifeíëŒ¢í«í_í«ŒÈs is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!  We are working to pay down debt - our mortgage is conventional and we pay towards principal on all other debts each month.

His situation is getting bad, and I have decided to assume this loan.  I don't want to be on the hook in 3 years when he gets out of college and all the while it's been accruing at 13%.  I don't have a high income at all, as you'll see, but I live at home with my parents, no rent, own my car outright, and like to pay down debt early.

I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked. If not, please feel free to ask any other questions you may have as a prospective lender.

I was downsizing my homes and had just closed escrow on a new smaller home. I had my older larger home on the market. Then the Calif market crashed. I lost my clients (banks) and had to close up shop. I was unemployed for several months. In the meantime I did everything I could to sell my home,but I could not, eventually it was foreclosed upon and I lost it. I lived off these cards until I found a job with a large company which I have been with for 4 years now. Because these cards were maxed it, the companies keep increasing my interest rates until it just got out of control. I am just sick of paying on them only to see most of my payment going to interest.I have tried to communicate with them, but I think because I'm never late, they won't budge.

I will venture an educated guess the majority of us have just gotten blind-sided by the ever increasing costs of EVERYTHING from med ins to heating fuel to gas. It just never seems to end. More stringent rules &amp; regs were put in place to protect the financial intitutions.

But unless youre credit score is in the 800's and have a 2nd income at home, banks just don't wanna talk to ya....Anyway, yes, the interest may be higher but I'm glad I found Lending Club, and the op to pre-pay w/out penalty exists if I am able in the future should my loan request fully fund! I have a goal - a strategy - 1 loan to pay off some debt w/ the much higher interest which will eventually facilitate looking for a house.

She had no medical insurance and Medicaid was insufficient.  Over the next couple of years, I spent over $100,000 assisting her with medical bills.  You'll be happy to know she's alive and well.  Unfortunately, at that time, I was making less than $60K a year.  After I burned through my savings, I accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt, most of it on credit cards (I had excellent credit then).  Needless to say, my debt level decreased my credit score by quite a lot.  After the catastrophe was over, I have continued to advance in my career and make payments on my debt.  While I'm making some progress, it's going very slowly and sometimes feels like I'll never be out of debt.  Still, over the past few years, I've greatly improved my credit by consistently paying on time and more than the minimum.  At this point, I would like to consolidate some of my debt into a simple lower rate interest installment loan rather than multiple compound interest revolving lines of credit at higher interest rates.

I typically pay more than the minimum due but the interest rates and annual fees keep going up and the banks continue to lower my credit line.  This is impacting my debt to credit ratio, which is further impacting my credit score.<br/><br/>Stability:  I've been employed with the same company for 15 years and work in IT.  I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)

My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.    The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we want to undertake a few small projects.  First, we need to purchase and install a new air conditioner before the summer, as the old unit is too small to cool the house adequately in the summer (apparently the prior owners only lived in the home during the winter months).    Second, there is an exterior golf cart garage that the prior owners enclosed to use as a storage area.  However, the construction was not done properly, and the drywall they used has become moldy and needs to be replaced.  Also, the foundation of the garage is below grade and needs to be repoured so that it does not accumulate water.  Finally, there are a few minor household projects we would like to undertake, such as installing some lighting and improving the airflow for our air conditioner/heater.    I would like to obtain a loan through Lending Club as opposed to disturbing our existing HELOC (which we took out at the same time we obtained our initial mortgage) because the HELOC contains a significant prepayment penalty.  We have explored other options such as financing the air conditioner through the installer, but the interest rates are too high for our liking.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!

My company then cancelled our 401K program and they counted the loan as dispersement and I got killed on my taxes.  I owed $11000 in taxes.  My husband then got a serious infection from kidney stones and our medical bills kept us living on credit.  I've been playing catch up ever since.  I'm trying to consolidate the debt and pay it off faster so I can get ahead.<br/> Borrower added on 06/05/10 > I am a 36 year old female.  I have been with my husband since high school and married 14 years.  I am the only female manager ever at my company which is been in business over 30 years. I have been very successful in my career and very well respected throughout the country. I am responsible and conservative in every way.  I have one 30 day late payment on a credit card in my entire credit history to which there is no good excuse.  I now have every bill on automatic payment and use a budgeting tool within my bank's software program to manage our money.  My husband is also employed and has been in retail since college.  He also has some small income from a business he is helping a friend start up.  When we needed to use more of our credit to make ends meet it lowered our score.  When we tried to pay them off, the credit card companies lowered our limits--which then lowered my score again.  I had always been in the 720 range prior to these events.  Frankly, I am a litle humiliated to even be going through this process as we have always been very blessed and financially secure.

Even though I informed the bank of my move and put a forwarding order in with the post office, I received my statement in the mail several days after it was due. Despite my shrinking debt, my immediate payment and my excellent payment history, the bank has now jacked my interest rate up to an astonishing amount.  Worse yet, the bank applies my payments to the lowest interest rate portions first, while the higher rate purchases simply keep accruing interest.  I have realized that there are a lot of games that traditional banks play to 'trap' and exploit their customers. So I really don't want to do business with them anymore if I can help it. I want to close my credit card account with this bank to protect my future.  I am looking for a loan to match (or come very close to) the rate of my credit card balance before this one late payment: 3.99%  I have the ability to transfer the balance to a different credit card, but then I would be charged an additional 3% up-front for the privilege, and that really doesn't help me financially.

My other card with Citibank has no balance, but the card I used for the transfer has $10,000 on it - I basically consolidated everything into this card - so now I would like to clear this card and just pay off a fixed rate installment loan instead.  I have never missed a payment or done anything else to warrant this rate increase from Citibank. When I called them to ask why, they said it was nothing to do with my credit or payment history.  I am not having any problems paying this account, I just don't think Citibank should take $100 a month from me in interest based on what they have done - I'd rather see it go to ordinary people.

The loan will go towards the upfront capital costs of furniture, appliances, and renovation to create a wonderful caring home for the future residents.  The loan will also help with the first few monthly payments until we have all 4 patients.  Revenue for this start-up will be split among 2 sources: patient's social security payments and patient's out of pocket payments (sometimes paid for by the patient's family members).  Based on conservative financial projections, it is estimated that positive cash flow will occur starting in month 7 and the overall break-even will occur at about month 15.  We are also investing in cost-saving initiatives (efficient showerheads, washer, dryer, light bulbs, etc.) to maximize cash flow.  We hope that you will help us fund this very promising venture.

The additional $500 will cover my closing costs and some of the very minor repair work that is needed.  This property will not have a mortgage against it because the loan amount would be so small.

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions.

However, if I have miss anything, ask away and I'll do my best to answer.<br/><br/>Employment<br/>==========<br/>I am a software engineer for a privately funded startup company. The company has been in existence for right at 2 years and I have been with them for 1.5. We integrate biometric solutions with banking software. Our investor is founder and chairman of one of the most widely used core banking systems in the world, which gives us a unique advantage as a startup. I will be traveling to Africa in October to install our second client. We also have 5 more signed contracts awaiting installation over the next 2 years.<br/><br/>Home Equity<br/>===========<br/>I refinanced my house earlier this year in order to convert it from a 7/1 ARM to a fixed 30-year and reduce the rate. The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.<br/><br/>Debts<br/>=====<br/>I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.<br/><br/>Budgeting<br/>=========<br/>I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:<br/><br/>$4820 : Net Monthly Income<br/>-------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 --------------<br/>$500 : Retirement<br/>$500 : Long Term Savings<br/>$500 : Short Term Savings<br/>$500 : Fun<br/>---------------------- 60 ---------------------<br/>$1250 : Mortgage<br/>$130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan)<br/>$100 : Power (average over last 3 bills)<br/>$30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$36 : Lawn<br/>$16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months)<br/>=====================================================<br/>$836<br/><br/>The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year. I intend on reducing my withholdings, which would increase my montly income beyond what is listed here.<br/><br/>Intentions<br/>==========<br/>The three year term on this loan is seen as a worst case to me.

The reason I'm applying for the loan is because I'm moving out of the room I've been living in for the past three years.  I moved into a tiny, tiny room in Westchester County.  It was so small I didn't even have a closet.  These past few years I've learned to use the space to my advantage.  I want to move out now because I'm in a comfortable spot in my life to do so.  I found a place in the Bronx that isn't exactly above my pay grade but one where it would leave me a bit underfunded given my bills.  Between the apartment fees, utilities, medical bills, and other monthly bills I don't feel with the loan I have I'll be able to live decently.  So I need the loan.  I have a very good job at CBS Radio, but I don't make as much as I want.<br/> Borrower added on 04/21/10 > I plan on using the funds for several reasons primarily for moving out.  The initial apartment fees are roughly $4000 dollars which includes the first month, last month, security deposit and broker fee.  After writing out a careful budget of all my essential bills (i.e. rent, electric, phone, transportation, food, medical) I realized I wouldn't be able to live decently.  I needed help.  So I am turning to get some help. <br/>I'm also using the loan to consolidate the remaining amount of my credit cards, which stands at $3700 dollars.  The remaining amount will be added to my account to help pay for my rent and other essential costs.  I want to mention that I am an extremely hardworking guy who constantly monitors his credit score.  I currently hold an average score of 750. I always pay my bills, pay more than the minimum, and keep an eye on what I spend.<br/> Borrower added on 04/26/10 > Living on my own has been a goal of mine for some time now.

I want to honor the debit AND to pay it off as quickly as possible. I have had folks tell me to not pay the hospital and for me frankly that is not honorable or morally right. So I am looking for solutions to pay comfortably and to pay fully.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower? I am dedicated to honesty and doing the right thing. I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget?

I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process.

I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for considering me as your next investment.<br/>",debt consolidation,Goodbye High Interest Credit Cards!!!,015xx,MA,7.78,2.0,11/01/1989,0.0,15.0,,10.0,0.0,20270,48.7,15.0,f,0.0,2,PC4

I have about $13k in credit card debt which is in excellent standing, never late and always pay more than the minimum. I also just paid off a new car loan for my wife's car (free and clear) and my own transport was bought outright a year ago with no debt outstanding.  I would like to reduce the APR on the $13k credit card debt I have and therefore be able to pay it off sooner. Borrower added on 01/15/10 > The credit card debt was mainly from paying for my daughters wedding in August 2008 and not from irresponsible spending. With the recent rate hikes from the banks it means I will have to carry this debt longer, but I would really like it paid and done with within 3-years.<br/>",credit card,Reduce high APR on 2 CC's & Consolidate,334xx,FL,9.51,0.0,06/01/2004,0.0,,,2.0,0.0,14401,92.9,6.0,f,0.0,1,PC5

We have already purchased three buses that will be used in our business.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcíëŒ¢í«í_í«_ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, íëŒ¢í«í_í«íèStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in AfricaíëŒ¢í«í_í«Œù, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",small business,Urban Transportation,750xx,TX,8.04,0.0,11/01/2005,1.0,,,7.0,0.0,14729,85.6,8.0,f,0.0,1,PC1

What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>",small business,Expansion,735xx,OK,0.0,0.0,04/01/2002,2.0,,,2.0,0.0,0,0.0,18.0,f,0.0,3,PC5

I have a research program that is actively funded by the National Institutes of Health.  What is important about these two points is that I have job stability and a steady, strong source of income.  I am never late on bills, which include student loans, a mortgage, car payment, and credit cards and personal loans.  I am looking to actively pay down debt over the next several years, starting with two accounts.  One is a credit card through Chase that was through Washington Mutual.  When the card transferred to Chase, the interest rate climbed from 10% to 29.99%.  Again, while I have never been late on a payment and continue to make the monthly minimum, I will be unable to pay down the debt (which now stands at just under $3,000) as quickly as I would like and desire a lower rate, something they cannot give to me for 12 months.   Also, a promotional purchase (centrail air installation and furnace work) on a Home Depot card is about to expire, and with it about a $1,000 of interest will be added to the principal amount (now just under $4000) of the loan.  This, combined with the high interest rate (26.99%, which also increased earlier this summer), will make it difficult for me to pay down the debt.  These two accounts are the two primary roadblocks to my plan to decrease my non-mortgage and student loan-related debts.    While my salary provides me with a reasonable debt-to-income ratio, it might sound strange that I underestimated the financial impact of my son following his birth in March of last year.  He began daycare last November, and the $200 weekly daycare payment has made disposable income at a premium, and my desire to make well more than the monthly minimums difficult.    I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and look forward to hearing from you.

I took one out last year through Lending Club, which went very well. I have always made the payments on time and kept up other debt in the meanwhile. I had hoped to have the current loan paid off within the next six months. Unfortunately, due to matters beyond my control and which I am not at liberty to disclose, I was forced to take on additional debt over the course of the last six months. Now that the matter has been resolved, I can continue to pay off the existing loan and also pay down the new debt accrued at a fairly aggressive rate; however, I would prefer to secure a new loan for a slightly larger amount and longer term. My goal is to pay off the loan in 3 years or preferably less. With that said, I am requesting a five-year loan with the idea the unexpected can happen so having a lower monthly amount due to begin with will allow me to keep money in savings for the unknown and not have to rely on credit cards. I will also try to pay more than is due each month in order to pay off the loan as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>Using this new loan I am committed to: paying off the existing Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months; pay off all outstanding credit card and personal loan debt, and leave myself with only this new monthly loan, a small auto loan, monthly rent and some associated bills, such as heating, etc.<br/><br/>I would be willing to agree to a loan of a lesser amount. However, for the sake of credit upkeep and repair, my aim is for the full amount in order to close out any other existing loans, and pay off all existing credit card debt.<br/> Borrower added on 09/14/11 > Note to potential investors: I currently have a Lending Club loan which has been open approximately 11 months and always paid on time. That loan is $415/month approximately. The new loan would pay off that 3-year loan and all other debt. The new terms would be only $10 more per month for a 5-year loan. I hope this very small ($10) adjustment per month and my history of paying this and all debt 100% on time will help you in your investment decision.  I will pay off the new loan, if received, before the 5-year term. The extended timeframe is merely a safety net, which allows me to pay the minimum due from time to time, though I plan to pay more than due each month 90% of the time, if not always.<br/>",debt consolidation,Debt Consildation Loan,488xx,MI,18.26,0.0,06/01/1994,1.0,48.0,,17.0,0.0,6060,35.9,37.0,f,0.0,3,PC2

When we first started planning, we decided that we wanted to wake up the day after our wedding having paid for it entirely, without any debt.  After analyzing our finances, we realized we needed a little help to reach our goal.  Our parents graciously volunteered to contribute $10,000 to our wedding.  However, as a result of the recent tumble of the stock market and housing markets, our parents are no longer able to help us pay for our wedding.    We don't want to cancel the wedding, as we've already paid $3,000 in deposits, and have friends and family who have already purchased plane tickets.  We decided instead to cut the guest list and trim back the menu, cut out luxuries like an open bar and fancy flower arrangements, and have reneogitated our contract with the venue and caterer.  As a result, we have managed to scale back our budget by 25%.    There are still some things that we really do not want to cut out, such as paying my grandmother's hotel and airfare so she can attend, as she wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise, and helping our parents with their plane tickets.    We plan to allocate $4,500 to actual expenses, and reserve $1,500 for emergencies.  Any cash we do not use will be paid back immediately.

Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollaräóÁí_ŒÈs ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who readäóÁí__ well I wonäóÁí_ŒÈt digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

I emailed (in today's world, who wouldn't?) everything within 24 hours and asked them to send me an email stating that all documents had been received. Instead, four days later, I received an email from LC stating that the loan had been denied due to incomplete paperwork. I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.  They confirmed that for the re-listed loan, they have already verified all information including employment, salary, and federal tax returns and if the loan is funded again, things would go smoothly.

I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.",small business,Stanford MedStudent SeekingInvestment$$,930xx,CA,14.98,0.0,01/01/2000,0.0,,,9.0,0.0,26333,77.2,14.0,f,0.0,1,PC2

I so far have been managing well but If I could consolidate my balances I'd be better off. I recently broke my leg and was on disability for four months which really threw me off track finacially.

She is afraid I will not be able to pay the loans back. Plus I also help her out financially. I know I can payoff a loan easily. I can afford up to 500 or more dollars to pay toward one bill. My issue is my bills are so spread out I end up paying all of them daily all at once and am constantly broke & struggling till my next check. I am trying my very best here guys but I need help. I have even decided to take some time off school to try & work extra to pay down my debt because I am very stressed by it. Someone please help, I will not let you down. I will pay up ! I don't want to ruin my credit and thats exactly why I am trying to take responsibility and get my situation under better control before it's our of control.

5658,5659,Accenture,1,RENT,100000.0,VERIFIED - income,n,"I am launching an apparel brand, starting with denim jeans with a unique design concept that was conceived in Sept 2007 that resulted in a design patent that was granted in April 2008.    The potential application of this design concept is huge, and currently there is nothing like it in the marketplace.  It enables the interchangeability (transform/morph) of different art, quotations, and graphic expressions on display.  After the design patent was granted in 2008, I slowly and gradually worked on preparing to get the brand off the ground.  This year, after sourcing materials and getting other resources in place, the 1st and 2nd prototypes are finally completed, with the 2nd improving by leaps and bound over the first.  To date, I have invested over $10K of my own capital into this venture, not to mention countless hours of work, and I enjoy every minute of it.  The loan will be used to take the venture into the next level by mostly funding the first production batch of denim jeans.  This production batch will anchor the first of many distribution channel by way of the MorphBrand.com website (currently under construction), and major apparel trade shows in the spring of 2010.  I am a good, reliable, and responsible candidate for the loan because I have excellent credit, low debt to credit ratio, and a stable and high income employment history in the still lucrative oil and gas industry in Houston Texas.

The gym will currently consist solely on the use of the gym and will offer Yoga and Pilates in the near future. Esther is registered to become a certified Yoga instructor mid-2009. According to City-Data.com (2009) the population of Belfair is over 6 thousand residents. Grapeview/Allyn also has a population of more than 2 thousand residents. The location, which is along highway 3 across from the Safeway store and next to the Kitsap bank, is the main thoroughfare to Bremerton for north-Mason Residents. The current facility has 72 individuals on a monthly payment plan to use the services. The only facility in the area is the one in place and has not allowed new members in several months. We will use advertising on the building, which is highly visible from the main thoroughfare of highway 3. The organization will also be referred clients from the sole local Physical therapy in Belfair, Belfair Physical therapy. Once the completion of the physical therapy is complete, Belfair Physical Therapy will recommend a membership at the establishment. We will also receive referrals from Abel Wellness, which is also located in the building to be used. 	The monthly price will be approximately $30 a month for the gym and $50 a month for access to the yoga and Pilates along with the gym. The current expected fixed cost is $5100 a month and will need approximately 170 members to break even. There are currently 72 members, therefore, only 100 more are needed to break even. 	Our Plan is for either Esther or Bradley to occupy the business during business hours and use an access control system for the after business hours.

Finally, I gained US citizenship and immediately applied for a job with at the State Department.  After a lengthy clearance process, I have now started as a strat comms officer on the newly formed Civilian Response Corps.  However, the move from Boston to DC was not paid for by my new employer and I incurred a lot of expense.  The move has set me back and I would like to get back on track as I start my new career.<br/><br/>Hopefully, some of this description has helped to explain my current predicament but also put your minds at ease given some of the information.  As a US Gov't employee, it is in my interest to behave more responsibly than your average borrower.  Plus, given the unique nature of my job (ie deployed to parts of the world most fear to tread), I expect to have my salary augmented by 'hardship' pay once I'm fully trained and deployed in the field.  Therefore, I expect to repay the loan a little earlier than expected but, for those of you interested in a little return on your investment, this probably won't occur within the first two years of the loan.  <br/><br/>I do have a couple of marks on my financial record, which despite my good credit now will cause some pause among lenders.  I get that.  However, the two separate incidents had more to do with administrative blunders, ie failing to set up the auto payment correctly before leaving the country for 6 weeks (for work) than they do about my unwillingness or inability to pay.  I learned VERY quickly from this and have maintained exemplary credit ever since.  And, I refer you back to my current employment status as evidence that this is the case.  <br/><br/>I appreciate any assistance this forum can provide and I'm grateful to your willingness to take the risk and help out.  I can only assure you, for whatever assurance you get online, that I am responsible, upstanding and have NO intention of defaulting on any loan, ever.<br/>",moving,DC State move,200xx,DC,4.33,2.0,08/01/2001,1.0,15.0,,4.0,0.0,0,0.0,18.0,f,0.0,3,PC3
